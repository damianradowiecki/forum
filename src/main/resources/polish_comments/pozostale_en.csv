The principle, however, is simple - less writing and nowhere criticism and more acts of correcting, according to such journalists, the reportedly inept rule of PiS. Maybe these kinds of writings should rely on previous governments and name their achievements and show that they were able to make groundbreaking changes on a larger scale than PiS now.'"

The journalist is the host of the programme and has no right to offend his guests or express his political views. The media is supposed to be impartial. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

The OP has since finally acknowledged that it has someone to lose to and that failure is inevitable and has begun to dig into all possible fronts by adopting hastily different laws to guarantee impunity for its members, synekury for years to come, the possibility of sabotaging the actions of the new power as soon as possible. PiS if you are serious about the rule of Poland and not about leting it down has to turn a lot of things around.

Therefore, en masse Muslims join organizations fighting us or infidars (they consider us servants of Satan people of democracy and Western civilization)Interestingly, the Bible speaks of the arrival of the Antichrist and the false Prophet, who will cooperate with each other. And the hadiths are talking about the coming of Mahdi their prophet and Isa(Jesus)Israel is waiting for the messiah because he did not recognize the Christian Jesus.The Bible speaks of a 7-year pact with the Antichrian, which confirms the Islamic hadith that their Prophet will make peace with the anolate prophet of Israel for 7years.isa messiah for the Jews)This would set a precedent in the world for such a pact. The Bible, and especially the Apocalypse, speaks of the sealing of its followers by the Antichrist.Hadith describes sealing his followers as their prophet appears with a magic seal to know who is a follower of Islam. Is there to be a false messiah and a false prophet for Islam in the future for Israel? The Bible says that this peace will be false in order to attack the peoples peacefully living in the middle of the earth (Europe)This gives a lot to think about, especially the fact that the emerging fighters have the belief that the prophet will soon appear what is behind the victory of Islam over Western civilization.'"

The Security Service files in the IPN archives concerning Lech Walesa are incomplete. It is known that in 1992â1994 Lech Wałęsa, as President of poland, applied to the UOP for their release. In 1996, there was a lack of parts of the documents and no borrowed microfilms. Several dozen numbered pages were drawn â it is not known today whether they returned to MSW dismantled or destroyed later to discredit Lech Walesa, as he maintains. and - On June 4, 2008, Polish President Lech Kaczyński stated in an interview with TV Polsat that TW Bolek is Lech Wałęsa.'"

Mariusz Błaszczak emphasized that the arguments raised by the opposition and hostile to the government of Prime Minister Beata Szydło were exaggerated and inconsistent, because first it was accused of not carrying out any new laws, then it was argued that these projects are too much and the Sejm must debate late at night. Then came the so-called Committee for the Defence of Democracy, but as the minister said, when fewer and fewer people started coming to the demonstrations organized by THE CODE, turning up the spiral of hysteria, brussels was turned to. However, this movement of communities that do not like the new power, as Mariusz Błaszczak points out, has proved Polish to be a misplaced one, because the European Union cannot impose any sanctions against it without unanimity of all its members, and after the meeting between PiS President Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, it is already known that such unanimity will not be.'"

The publication of the materials disgraced our government on the international air and the newspaper that published it made financial profits.
The perpetrator cannot be identified because journalists have journalistic ethics. Coming out eavesdropping on politicians is the best business. The offender can eavesdrop and is unpunished, while the police no longer. 
The biggest paranoid part is that the OP's opponents don't see anything wrong with that. It is true that now they can eavesdrop legally so they have secured themselves. 
In all this, the good of the Polish that is, all of us, is not just the interests of one party. PIS and OP will share Poland so much that we will soon start to cut among ourselves as there in the Middle East.'"

Anyway, bad to feel with us, there is alcohol, pork, there are no mosques, and girls walk in mini and t-shirts, so it would be the fault of these girls that they were raped ...
Don't accept Muslim refugees - and there will be no problem. Help them at a distance in their neighbouring countries of origin. Because if a man fleeing war crosses the fields of the world, and still complains that he will not live in Greece, he only wants to Germany or England!!!  Absurd!!!
All countries (except GERMANY) are withdrawing from the policy of accepting Muslim refugees after a series of attacks in Paris !!!!
How does someone offer free housing and lifetime allowance (without the compulsion to work) do you not think that the WHOLE WORLD will go to Europe?  This is like staying on an eternal holiday, without trouble and no worries ;))) And the best thing about all of this is that we (Europeans) will pay for it with our own money, like slaves for our Arab lords.  You can help them at a distance in neighbouring countries, not bring them to our countries and homes. And finally, Muslims will give us war on our own lands to establish a caliphate !!!!."

Hence the conclusion that this is done by those who cannot come to terms with the fact that they have lost power, or those who are in power with such desperation as the Modern. I am sorry to see the representatives of this party with a cheeky smile on their faces talking about downgrading, discussing Poland in the European Parliament or Poland on their knees.

And PiS is having fun:) In their opinion, it is not more worth sitting in the parliament after nights. They explain that they are going to Jachranka to work. Their place of work is the benches at the Village, not the ballrooms in hotels.

"'Lech Wałęsa was an SB agent with registration number 12535 registered on 29 XII 1970 as a secret collaborator of Bolek and probably recruited on 19 XII 1970 on a voluntary basis by Capt. SB Edward Graczyk. It was deregistered from the operational records of SB 19 VI 1976 due to a reluctance to cooperate.
Bolek provided SB m.in. with information about the mood at the W-4 department of the shipyard, the circumstances of the arson of the PZPR headquarters in Gdańsk, the compensation for December 1970, the attempted disruption of the procession on 1 May 1971. He also identified the participants in the December protest on video.
Bolek also reported on his colleagues. In total, at least 24 people were reported, most not far from Józef Szyller. As a result, the victims of the reports were persecuted and harassed in various ways.
Bolek contacted three SB officers â Capt. Edward Graczyk, Capt. Henryk Rapaczyński and Capt. Zenon Ratkiewicz. Capt. Czesław Wojtalik also took part in the inspection meeting with Bolek. The reports were also transmitted through an SB resident on the premises of The Gdańsk Shipyard Capt. Józef Dąbek.
Bolek was assessed positively by SB officers. Attention was paid to his punctuality, discipline, willingness to cooperate, meticulousness, ingenuity and commitment. He also performed operational tasks during the illness.
The retained documentation on TW Bolek's activities is so scant that it does not allow for a comprehensive description and assessment of its activity.
In the 1970s and 1990s, the Gdańsk SB had four agents codenamed Bolek, but only one of them lived in Gdańsk and worked at the Gdańsk Shipyard
From 1980 to 1981 Wałęsa maintained confidential contacts with the communist authorities, m.in met secretly with Deputy Interior Minister Adam Krzysztoporski.
During Walesa's internment in martial law, operational actions were initiated to discredit him by disclosing cooperation with the SB in the eyes of the underworld and the Western world (so that he would not receive the Nobel Peace Prize).
In the 1990s, the with the help m.in of the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Milczanowski, the SB documentation collected about TW Bolek was twice loaned to the President's Office and dismantled by Lech Walesa.
In the 1990s, the the charges against Andrzej Milczanowski, Jerzy Konieczny and Gromosław Czempiński concerning the loss of documents relating to the case of TW Bolek (allegations in accordance with Article 262 d.kk) were finally dropped by a final order. This action was dictated by changes in criminal law.
Between 1992 and 1995, fakes appeared in place of some of the original documents relating to the TW Bolek case.
In 2000, the Court of Mirroring misjudged the evidence on the Walesa and skipped part of them.

Well, it turned out that a lady actually promised to accept 100,000 cultural enrichers. Each of them could bring his family usually from 6 to 8 people. After a year there were already 800,000 enrichers in Poland. It turned out that for a year they were not able to learn Polish - of course, because it is a difficult language. As a result, they continued to live with social donations. Poland could either raise taxes or become indebted again... The retirement age can also be raised - the most important thing is that we are culturally enriched. It turned out that our new companions multiply their people very quickly. When in Poland the average family has 1.39 children in them this rate is from 6-8 children per family. What luck!! After 18 years, the number of enrichers has increased by 4!!! What luck! It turned out that among them a few are really dull heads and are doing great in politics. All their supporters voted for them, and they made great use of the law on an infinite number of mosques, minarets and mandatory Sharia law. What luck!!!!! From history books, our children have finally begun to learn the truth about how the greatest Polish islamophobic John III SOBIESKI has acted and is unskine to be called a hero. What a true statement! After a few years, the EU changed its name to FRAJELANDIA. - What do you think was a nightmare or maybe a prophetic dream as once people stunned by TVN will choose a modern sweater market!

"'Found on the web: Poland is ruled by GTW - Power Holding Group (WSI, prosecutors and judges). The network is being held for murder by the threat of suicide, everyone is eavesdropped on. GTW controls the media. She set up an OP. In 2005 PIS messed up because they came up with the gtw trail. Blida was removed at the time of her arrest because she knew a lot and would pour in. The PIS coalition was broken up. The PKW was taken over and the elections are falsified from now on. As Lech Kaczynski strengthened the armed forces and blocked the PO government, it was deleted. Called Bronka figurantbo have hooks. For 8 years there was paradise. Investment and privatisation accounted for 10-20%. The pkw exchange stirred and kkw looked at his hands. They cast only 15% of the vote and bronk was not maintained. Their polls gave 60% PIS, 6% PO, 1% PSL and 25% Kukiza. It was wrong and the TS Law on the President's dismissal was amended and 5 judges were substituted in the CT. Polls showed that the PIS and OP have similar results to give a final say. Petru is a GTW creation and their cash - no credit Petru. Palikota was brought to the SLD to pull them to the bottom (Palikot is a GTW creature). Kukiz was pressed on the mole lists to disrupt the environment. 200 people were called to write on the forums badly about PIS and Kukizie and well about the OP and Petru. It was impossible to put up enough cards and the PIS got power. Kukiz was taken away and the PSL was added so that the constitution would not be changed. GTW went on to ridicule Duda and the PIS for deceiving voters that taxes and prices would rise. It is to be an action that the PIS wants a civil war and threatens war with Russia, Germany and the EU, that the PIS is fascism, totalitarianism, backward Catholicism and shame on the whole of Europe. Fox has sent criticism to newspapers in Germany and the US and write that the Western media criticize PISâ. GTW knows that pis is in possession of information about them and will not allow Ziobro to take over the prosecutor's office. Kulczyk's death would not be faked because it is about a giga scam involving the first people. Ts was waived for Ziobro and Kaczynski because there was a fear that they would reveal them. Kaminski's pardon prevented him, because he knows a lot. Kopacz had away meetings to mount eavesdropping in shelving, desks and under plaster on ceilings (more than 100). Cells and email PIS and Kukiza on eavesdropping. Duda has wiretapping everywhere - she was yelling as he went at night to the president because they don't have one there. GTW called the CODE for riots. There is a plan to erase Duda and solve the Sejm, put Duda, Kaczynski, Ziobra, Macierewicz and Kamiński before the TS and solve the PIS. There is a law prohibiting demonstrations. Therefore, the PIS should replace the PKW, make a new programme and establish a new mode of elections without nullity of votes and name the composition of the TS and TK. It urgently needs to take over TVP. This will save themselves and Poland. GTW will not give up and will not stop from attacks because he has to lose giga finances.

I recommend necessarily topics; Three Days of Darkness, JPII in Fulda, Revelation in Akita, p. Malachi about popes, Petrus Romanus Francis.

Without any rules, it has become a dumpster of all kinds of views, behaviors, etc. The worst part is that, in the name of misunderstood liberalism, there are no arguments to defend any rules, because there are no such principles. It is more important to accept everything and not accept anything that requires any effort. As long as politicians think so, Europe will be on an incly slope. Europe can only be saved by Christianity, which is what has always been the foundation of its culture and identity. And it is not that everyone becomes Christians, but that the values of this religion, which are universal, are something natural in the life of every European. Islam is another fairy tale. A different mentality. A different culture. A different world. Certainly not Europe.'"
