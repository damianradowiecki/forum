As is well known, the sejm of the previous legislature created a strange law, called Law 1066, the intention of which is not entirely known. The new provisions legalize so-called fraternal assistance, that is, the armed intervention of foreign troops on the territory of our country. Is the political situation in our country currently heated up by foreign forces heading towards such a force solution? Until a few months ago, it seemed that Law 1066 was just another symptom of widespread legislative diarrhea in our country. It turns out, however, that this right can be used by political forces lost in elections to return to power. At present, this scenario seems unlikely, but events are accelerating very quickly and it can be seen with the naked eye that the forces that exercised power in Poland after the pupation of the Polish People's Republic in The Third Republic do not intend to forgive and are preparing an attack. In the preparation of the substructure for the planned coup, all the salon media are used, which short-circuited the chic and foolish Poles with bizarre propaganda, that democracy was threatened. Unfortunately, many mentally volatile citizens of our country sip stories such as the proverbial hungry pelicans. At the same time as the propaganda storm, there are also statements in the media from representatives of the detached establishment trough, which may suggest a planned sequence of events.

"'@@@-It is true that we now have governments that are full and satisfied with the system of townspeople (lemmings). They live at the expense of the majority of Poles, who are exploited and earn pennies.

In principle, our country's economy operates only through low labour costs. That is: salaries are not enough for anything at prices like those of the West, one does for three, a lack of social rights and privileges, a widespread violation of workers' rights. This is how the economy is organized either by a third world country or by a country that is a colony (actually: a semi-colony).

The basic argument of these wealthy and wealthy is that salaries simply cannot be raised. However, this is utter nonsense. Yes, it is possible, only so far there has been no political will among the elites. They were matched by a colonial dependence on draining our resources and exploiting foreign capital workers.

This system is called neoliberalism or capitalism. Its main principle is that capital and wealth always go mostly to the top of the social pyramid. Inequalities and exploitation this system has programmed from the beginning. In the construction industry, when specialists and workers began to travel to the West en masse, salaries immediately increased. There you earn 4000, 6000, sometimes even 8000. And that's what Poles should earn at these prices.

Now the full pasibrzuchy, which have taken over the ediness of most Poles, want to go out on the streets and do ârevolujationâ. Among these striped bellies from large corporations, young people are not seen at all. The average age there is 45 years. It is understood â€ the system has driven young people into a 12-hour work and earnings of £2,000 gross.

As is well known, the sejm of the previous legislature created a strange law, called Law 1066, the intention of which is not entirely known.

Is the political situation in our country currently heated up by foreign forces heading towards such a force solution? Until a few months ago, it seemed that Law 1066 was just another symptom of widespread legislative diarrhea in our country. It turns out, however, that this right can be used by political forces lost in elections to return to power. At present, this scenario seems unlikely, but events are accelerating very quickly and it can be seen with the naked eye that the forces that exercised power in Poland after the pupation of the Polish People's Republic in The Third Republic do not intend to forgive and are preparing an attack. In the preparation of the substructure for the planned coup, all the salon media are used, which short-circuited the chic and foolish Poles with bizarre propaganda, that democracy was threatened. Unfortunately, many mentally volatile citizens of our country sip stories such as the proverbial hungry pelicans. At the same time as the propaganda storm, there are also statements in the media from representatives of the detached establishment trough, which may suggest a planned sequence of events.
