"'Quote from the netWładimir Putin gave a speech about tensions with minorities in Russia. He said: ""Every minority representative, coming from anywhere in the world, if he wants to live and work in Russia, should speak Russian, and follow Russian law. If a Muslim prefers Sharia law, we advise him to move to those countries where Sharia law applies. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. It is these minorities who need Russia to protect them, but we will not create special privileges or change our rights according to their wishes. They can shout out loud about discriminationâ€ We will not tolerate disrespect for our Russian culture. Such cultural suicide takes place in America, England, the Netherlands and France, and Muslims will capture power in these countries. If we are to survive as a nation, Then Russia will not go down this path. Russian law and traditions are irreconcilable with the lack of culture and primitive sharia customs. And if our honourable legislator (Duma) believes that new laws should be created, it must first of all bear in mind Russia's interest and remember that Muslim minorities are not Russian.â€ President Putin's words to the Duma members have received a standing ovation.
Mr Putin, I would like to thank you for your For these words I love you!!! Such a leader is needed in Europe! Such a leader would make order with Arabs and mosques!!!! collapse'"

"'Very good summary. Every thinking person was aware that this would be the case, because we have the state of public finances that we have. So it was known that these promises from space are not to be realized in the coming years. Now there will be less cash, because in the appropriated institutions tzreba pay a lot of severance payments. 500+ idea is not known what will take shape, but you can expect that few will benefit from it, and not exactly those to be helped, only combinators with learned helplessness syndrome, who already in the times of the Polish People's Republic lived at everyone's expense and will continue to have a good time. Retirement age is also a gift to yourself, as pensions are supposed to be lower. And yet their height is hopeless. Yes, probably many people will go to the lower ones and reach out again to social care. Unless the new rules make provision that those who go before are not entitled to care assistance. Hucpa pisu consists in the fact that the promises are directed as government projects, so they have to go through the whole procedure of consultation, arrangements, etc. On the other hand, laws that appropriate everything possible in a gangster style are enacted on the run and immediately implemented. So it is known that the TKM rule applies. And the rest, someday it may pass, but probably at the end of the term, for implementation to have to be put in place by the government, after the next election.'"
